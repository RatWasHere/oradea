    <b>ORADEA Privacy Policy</b><br>
    Effective date: December 22nd, 2025
    <br><br>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    ORADEA is a rhythm game distributed globally via Steam.  
    We do not independently collect personal data such as names, email addresses, IP addresses, or payment information.
    Most data processing related to accounts, payments, online services, and Workshop functionality is handled directly
    by Valve Corporation through Steam.
    <br><br>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <b>Locally stored game data:</b><br>
    The game stores data locally on your device, including:
    <ul>
      <li>Scores and performance results</li>
      <li>Accuracy metrics</li>
      <li>Timing of input events relevant to gameplay and scoring</li>
      <li>Game settings and configuration preferences</li>
    </ul>
    This data does not directly identify you and remains on your device unless shared via Steam features.<br>
    We do not collect analytics or telemetry data.
    <br><br>

    <b>Leaderboard submissions:</b><br>
    If you choose to submit a score to the leaderboards, relevant performance data may be transmitted to Valve using the
    Steam Leaderboards API in order to display your ranking.
    <br><br>

    <b>Steam Workshop content:</b><br>
    When you upload or download content via Steam Workshop, Steam may collect and process information such as your Steam
    account ID, uploaded content, and usage statistics.  
    We do not have access to your Steam account credentials or personal account details.
    Data related to Workshop functionality is processed in accordance with
    <a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/privacy_agreement/">Steam's Privacy Policy</a>.
    <br><br>

    <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
    Locally stored data is used solely for:
    <ul>
      <li>Gameplay functionality</li>
      <li>Score calculation and validation</li>
      <li>Basic anti-cheat and fairness measures</li>
    </ul>
    We do not sell, rent, or trade personal data.  
    We do not access Workshop content or Steam account information directly.
    <br><br>

    <h2>4. Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)</h2>
    For users in the European Economic Area, processing is based on:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Performance of a contract</b> (Article 6(1)(b)) - operating the game and saving progress</li>
      <li><b>Legitimate interests</b> (Article 6(1)(f)) - score validation and anti-cheat measures</li>
      <li><b>Consent</b> (Article 6(1)(a)) - optional submission of scores to leaderboards</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    Locally stored game data is retained until you delete it, reset it in-game (if applicable), or uninstall the game.
    Leaderboard and Workshop data is retained according to Steam's data retention policies.
    <br><br>

    <h2>6. International Data Transfers</h2>
    Steam services operate globally. If you choose to use online features such as leaderboards or Workshop, your data may
    be processed outside your country of residence in accordance with Steam's Privacy Policy and applicable data
    protection safeguards.
    <br><br>

    <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
    Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to:
    <ul>
      <li>Access your data</li>
      <li>Request correction or deletion</li>
      <li>Object to or restrict processing</li>
      <li>Withdraw consent for optional features</li>
    </ul>
    Since most data is stored locally, you can exercise these rights by deleting local game data or uninstalling the
    game.  
    Requests related to Steam-processed data should be directed to Valve.
    <br><br>

    <h2>8. Security</h2>
    We take reasonable measures to protect locally processed data. However, we cannot guarantee absolute security,
    particularly for data managed by third-party services such as Steam.
    <br><br>

    <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
    ORADEA is not intended for children under the age of 13.  
    We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.  
    Access to the game is subject to Steam's parental controls and policies.
    <br><br>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.  
    Changes will be reflected with a revised effective date.
    <br><br>

    <h2>11. Data Controller</h2>
    The developer of ORADEA acts as the data controller only for locally processed game data.  
    Valve Corporation acts as an independent data controller for all Steam-related services.
    <br><br>
