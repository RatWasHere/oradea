      patterns, and high-contrast strobing effects. A very small percentage of people may experience seizures or
      blackouts triggered by light patterns, even with no history of epilepsy. If you or anyone in your family has an
      epileptic condition or has experienced seizures of any kind, consult a physician before playing. STOP PLAYING
      IMMEDIATELY and consult a doctor if you experience any of the following symptoms: dizziness, altered vision, eye
      or muscle twitches, loss of awareness, disorientation, involuntary movements, or convulsions.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Physical Activity & Repetitive Stress Warning:</strong> This rhythm game requires rapid, repetitive, and
      forceful physical inputs that may cause or aggravate physical injuries including but not limited to repetitive
      strain injury (RSI), carpal tunnel syndrome, tendonitis, muscle strain, and joint damage. Stop playing immediately

      arms, shoulders, neck, or any other body part.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Input Device Damage Warning:</strong> The intense and rapid gameplay may cause accelerated wear, damage,
      or complete failure of keyboards, mice, controllers, touchscreens, or other input devices. This may include but is
      not limited to: broken keys or buttons, damaged switches, worn surfaces, disconnected components, or electronic
      failure. You acknowledge that intensive gameplay may contribute to accelerated wear of input devices. To the extent
      permitted by applicable law, we are not responsible for normal wear and tear or damage resulting from use during gameplay.

    <ul>
      <li>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages,
        including but not limited to loss of profits, data, or use, damage to property, personal injury, or medical
        expenses arising from your use of the Game.</li>

      <li>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we are not liable for damage to input devices, computer equipment, mobile devices, or other property

      <li>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, if you acquired the Game for free, our total liability shall not exceed $10 USD.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>10. Changes to These Terms</h3>
    We may update these Terms from time to time.
    Continued use of the Game after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
    <br><br>

    <h3>11. Severability</h3>
    If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and
    effect.
    <br><br>

    Mandatory consumer protection laws in your jurisdiction remain unaffected.
